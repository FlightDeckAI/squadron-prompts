Thanks for improving a conservative, reference-driven prompt library.

## What we accept
Prompts that are:
- Unclassified and non-sensitive
- Conservative and safety-focused
- Clear, reusable, and well-scoped
- Structured (inputs, output format, verification steps)
- Explicitly reference validation against AFIs/TOs/unit standards

## What we do not accept
Prompts that:
- Include weapons employment/tactics instruction, threat reactions, or classified capabilities
- Provide step-by-step mission execution procedures as a substitute for publications
- Encourage bypassing training rules or standards
- Copy large copyrighted/controlled text from publications

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo
2. Add/edit prompts in `prompts/`
3. Keep formatting consistent
4. Open a PR describing intent and limitations

## Standard prompt format
Each prompt section should include:
- **When to use**
- **Inputs**
- **Prompt**
- **Expected output**
- **Verification checklist**
- **Limitations / OPSEC note**
