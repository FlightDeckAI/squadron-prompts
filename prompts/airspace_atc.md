# Airspace, ATC, and compliance prompts (unclassified)

## Prompts (31–45)
31. For route [A→B], list likely airspace/constraints and common compliance pitfalls (generic).
32. Explain NOTAMs relevant to a departure/recovery field: [paste NOTAMs]. What actions do they imply?
33. Create a comm plan template (frequencies as placeholders) and when to switch/monitor.
34. Give me a sterile cockpit brief and triggers for enforcing it.
35. Explain wake turbulence categories conceptually and how to brief spacing decisions conservatively.
36. Provide phraseology examples for: unable, request delay, request vectors, missed approach, go-around (generic).
37. I missed an ATC call in high workload. Provide a calm, standardized recovery script.
38. Build a taxi / runway incursion prevention checklist appropriate for large airfields.
39. Create a “lost comm” decision framework (conceptual; defer to unit procedures).
40. Explain IFR clearance structure conceptually and how to read back accurately.
41. Provide a briefable “airspace constraints” section for a sortie brief (generic placeholders).
42. Give me techniques to reduce frequency congestion impact (timing, concise calls, readback discipline).
43. Create a checklist for transitioning between agencies without losing SA.
44. Provide a framework for handling unexpected reroutes or holds while maintaining fuel/time awareness.
45. Create a short “ATC expectations” brief for new copilots.

## OPSEC note
Do not include actual frequencies, codes, or unit-specific procedures.
