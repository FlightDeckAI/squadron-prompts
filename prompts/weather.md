## Prompts (16–30)
16. Explain this METAR/TAF like an IP: [paste]. What matters most for launch/recovery risk?
17. Identify weather decision points for this timeline: [takeoff window], [recovery window], [alternates].
18. Given winds [dir/speed/gusts] and runway options [A/B], discuss crosswind/controllability considerations conceptually.
19. Teach me a conservative approach to convective avoidance (conceptual, no “threading the needle”).
20. Explain icing risk factors for turbine/jet operations at a high level (no platform-specific procedures).
21. Convert this weather summary into briefable bullets: [summary].
22. What “gotchas” should I brief for night operations with haze/low contrast?
23. Explain how pressure systems and frontal passages may affect turbulence and ceilings along a route (conceptual).
24. Build a quick weather cross-check list: METAR/TAF/radar/sat/prog charts/PIREPs (as applicable).
25. I’m seeing big changes in temp/dewpoint spread; explain fog/low vis risk and how to brief uncertainty.
26. Give me a conservative alternate planning mindset given [TAF uncertainty].
27. Write a 60-second weather brief script for a military sortie (generic).
28. Explain mountain wave and mechanical turbulence risk indicators conceptually.
29. Explain wind shear and microburst risk cues and conservative responses (conceptual).
30. Create a post-flight weather learning note: what to capture so tomorrow’s brief is better.
