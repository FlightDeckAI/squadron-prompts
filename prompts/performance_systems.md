# Performance, fuel, and systems prompts (conceptual)

## Prompts (46–60)
46. Build a “performance planning” checklist that forces me to validate the critical numbers from the TO/flight manual.
47. Explain density altitude impacts on takeoff/climb conceptually with an example (no platform numbers).
48. Provide a fuel planning workflow: required vs recommended reserves, alternates, and decision points (generic).
49. Create a “fuel awareness” cross-check cadence for multi-phase sorties.
50. Explain CG and loading effects on handling/stability conceptually.
51. Provide a framework for interpreting caution/advisory messages: immediate actions vs confirm vs troubleshoot (conceptual).
52. Create a systems study plan for [system]: how to learn, how to brief, and common failure modes (conceptual).
53. Build a “human factors” checklist for preventing configuration errors.
54. I keep missing a step in a checklist flow. Suggest techniques to improve checklist discipline.
55. Provide a generic electrical/power issue troubleshooting framework (reference-first).
56. Create a decision tree for when to discontinue training due to maintenance issues (generic).
57. Give me a plan to reduce “automation surprise” and improve mode awareness (conceptual).
58. Help me write a preflight equipment inspection flow that is systematic and repeatable.
59. Turn this aircraft discrepancy narrative into clear write-up language: [text].
60. Create a post-flight discrepancy capture checklist (what to log, what to describe).
