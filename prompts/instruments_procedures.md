# Instruments and procedures prompts (conceptual)

## Prompts (76–88)
76. Explain an approach plate briefing flow conceptually (no platform-specific minima).
77. Build a short script for briefing a departure procedure: routing, constraints, and threats (generic).
78. Teach holding entries with a simple mental model (conceptual).
79. Create an instrument scan improvement plan with measurable drills.
80. Provide a “single-pilot IFR workload” mitigation plan (even if you usually fly crewed).
81. Explain stabilized approach criteria conceptually and how to call it early.
82. Write a missed approach / go-around brief structure and crew responsibilities.
83. Create a kneeboard quick reference format (headings only; no controlled info).
84. Provide a method to reduce “fixation” and maintain big-picture SA in IMC.
85. Explain autopilot/flight director mode awareness at a conceptual level; propose a briefable cross-check.
86. Create an IFR contingency set: reroute, hold, alternate, fuel (generic).
87. Simulate a procedural scenario: [scenario]. Ask me what I’d do next step-by-step and coach after each.
88. Create a 2-week instrument proficiency plan focused on weak areas: [list].
