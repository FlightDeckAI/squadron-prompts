# Crew procedures, CRM, and comm discipline prompts

## Prompts (61–75)
61. Build a crew comm contract: standard callouts for [phase], and what triggers intervention.
62. Provide a concise brief for division of duties: PF/PM (or aircraft commander/copilot) responsibilities (generic).
63. Create a standard “challenge and response” mindset checklist for high-risk phases.
64. Give me techniques to improve cross-monitoring and trap subtle errors.
65. Write a “new wingman/copilot” integration brief: expectations, comm norms, and debrief culture.
66. Provide a briefable checklist to reduce task saturation during abnormal events (conceptual).
67. Create a tool to identify when I’m behind the jet and how to get ahead again.
68. Explain how to give corrective feedback in the jet without ego or ambiguity.
69. Build a pre-brief for formation of thought: priorities, gates, triggers, and conservative margins (no tactics).
70. Create a “handoff” script for control transfers, radios, and nav updates.
71. Provide callouts to prevent runway/approach surprises.
72. Draft a sterile cockpit reminder callout set.
73. Provide a framework for managing fatigue on sortie day and during long missions (unclassified).
74. Create a checklist for post-mission crew coordination: logs, data, lessons, next actions.
75. Give me 10 “CRM failure patterns” and how to recognize them early.
